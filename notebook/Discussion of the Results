Discussion of Results
1. Model Performance
R² Score (0.7489): The model explains 74.89% of the variance in house prices, indicating a moderately strong fit.
Mean Squared Error (20.39): The average prediction error is approximately $4.51 (√20.39), which is reasonable 
given the price range (dataset mean: $22.7K, range: $5K–$50K).
Interpretation:
The model performs well but could benefit from feature engineering or hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
Potential underfitting: If the dataset has non-linear relationships, consider polynomial features or tree-based 
models (e.g., Random Forest).

2. Key Influencing Features
Feature	Coefficient	Impact on Price
DisadvantagedPosition	-4.58	Strongest negative effect
Rooms	+2.48	Strongest positive effect
Distance	-2.97	Prices drop farther from key locations
Accessibility	+2.33	Better access raises prices

3. Conclusion
This linear regression model provides a solid baseline for house price prediction, identifying economically 
intuitive drivers. Future work should address multicollinearity and explore advanced modeling techniques for higher accuracy.
